# CTP431-Final-Project
2016 Fall CTP431 Final Project

For Final Project, I made Simple MML Player with FM Synthsizer.
As a basic MML parsing code, I used this link
https://framesynthesis.com/experiments/synthesis.js/examples/showcase/

then I connected midi signal output from mml parser to FM synthesizer.
